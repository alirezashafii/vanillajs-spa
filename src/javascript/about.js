            In the 19th century the rivalry between Russia and Great Britain 
            in Iran took the form of economic intervention. After losing several battles 
            with Russia, Iran was forced to grant economic and naval benefits to that 
            country in Gīlān, under the treaties of 1813 and 1828. In 1907 Great Britain 
            and Russia divided Iran into three zones; the northernmost, including 
            the province of Gīlān, was the Russian zone. These events led to 
            the growth of nationalist movements, and contingents recruited from Tabrīz, 
            Gīlān, and Esfahān liberated Tehrān, with the result that Ahmad Mīrzā, 
            son of Shāh Mohammad Alī, was proclaimed ruler. In the aftermath 
            of the Russian Revolution, Bolshevik troops had control 
            of almost the entire Iranian Caspian seacoast, and 
            a separatist group proclaimed the short-lived Soviet Socialist Republic of Gīlān. 
            In the treaty of 1921 the Soviet Union handed back the region around Enzeli 
            and gave Iran equal navigation rights on the Caspian Sea.

            Gīlān divides into a coastal plain including the large delta of the Safīd Rūd 
            and adjacent parts of the Elburz Mountains. The soil is fertile loam, with dunes 
            and marshy stretches along the lower plain. The jungle-like forest contains partly 
            endemic species such as the Caucasian wingnut (a kind of walnut), and silk trees 
            cover part of the plain. Animals include wild boar, lynx, panther, hyena, jackal, 
            and deer, with waterfowl in the coastal stretches. On most cultivated land in Gīlān, 
            rice is grown. Other crops include tobacco, fruits, vegetables, and tea (grown in 
            the foothills above the rice fields). Fishing, developed by the Russians in the 19th century, 
            has been government run since 1953 and is important; most of the catch 
            (sturgeon, salmon, whitefish) is either dried or canned and is exported, 
            as is the caviar, which in the early 1970s accounted for about one-fifth 
            of world production. Gīlān has a few modern factories, mainly for tea and rice processing. 
            Modern developments include a dam at Manjīl.

            Gīlān’s capital and commercial centre is Rasht, which has a silk mill and a plant processing 
            kenaf (hemp) fibre; rice-straw mats are also made. Rasht is linked to Qazvīn, Tehrān, 
            and other coastal ports by road; it has an airport, and a natural-gas pipeline passes through 
            the city en route to Azerbaijan. Mahījān, Langarūd, and Bandar-e Anzalī (a busy Caspian port) 
            are other important economic centres. Area 5,679 square miles (14,709 square km). Pop. (2006) 2,404,861.

            It's about 15 miles (24 km) south of the Caspian Sea on a branch of the Sefīd River, 
            where the higher ground merges into the marshlands fringing the Mordāb, or Anzalī (formerly Pahlavī), 
            lagoon. Rasht’s importance as the main city of the Gīlān region dates from Russia’s southward expansion 
            in the 17th century. The city suffered severely during World Wars I and II from Russian occupation and 
            afterward from economic decline. The city is surrounded by rice fields and areas of half-cleared jungle. 
            The mostly two-storied houses have much woodwork, such as broad verandas and overhanging eaves; roofs are 
            red-tiled, and the houses often are raised from the ground. Modernization is confined to the main streets.
