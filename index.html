              Gilan, province, northwestern Iran, bounded by the Caspian Sea and
              the Republic of Azerbaijan on the north, Ardabil province on the west, 
              Zanjan province on the southwest, Qazvin province on the south, 
              and Mazandaran province on the east. The capital is Rasht.
              Gilan was within the sphere of influence of the successive Achaemenian, 
              Seleucid, Parthian, and Sāsānian empires that ruled Iran until the 7th century ce. 
              The subsequent Arab invasion of Iran led to the rise of many local dynasties, 
              and Gilan acquired an independent status that continued until 1567. 
              Gilan is mentioned in The Regions of the World, a Persian geography of 982. 
              During the rule (1073–92) of Malik-Shah, the third Seljuq sultan, 
              a secret sect of Isma'ilis who formed the core of Shiʿite resistance against 
              the Seljuqs was established in Gilan and eventually became known as the Assassins. 
              The Turko-Mongol invasions in the 13th century resulted in a huge influx of refugees, 
              including the Qajars, into the sparsely populated region. 
              The Qajars helped the Safavid rulers seize power at the beginning of the 16th century. 
              Later the Qajars sided with Nadir Shah in 1736, when he was threatened by the Afghans. 
              The Qajars rose as a dynastic power in 1796, displacing the Zand dynasty. Olearius, 
              an 18th-century traveller, mentions the Gilan fisheries.
